To create a Temperature Alert Agent using the uAgent library, we can follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies:
pip install uagent
Create a new Python file and import the necessary libraries:

import uagent
import requests
import json
import time

Define a function to fetch the real-time temperature for a given location:

def get_temperature(location):
    """Fetches the real-time temperature for a given location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

    Args:
        location: The location for which to fetch the temperature.

    Returns:
        The real-time temperature in degrees Celsius.
    """

    api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
    url = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={location}&appid={api_key}"
    response = requests.get(url)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = json.loads(response.content.decode())
        temperature = data["main"]["temp"]
        return temperature
    else:
        raise Exception("Failed to fetch temperature")

Define a function to send an alert/notification to the user:

def send_alert(message):
    """Sends an alert/notification to the user.

    Args:
        message: The message to send.
    """

    # TODO: Implement this function to send an alert/notification to the user using a preferred method, such as email, SMS, or push notification.
    pass

Create a main function to start the Temperature Alert Agent:

def main():
    # Get the user's preferred temperature range and location.
    minimum_temperature = float(input("Enter the minimum temperature: "))
    maximum_temperature = float(input("Enter the maximum temperature: "))
    location = input("Enter the location: ")

    # Create a uAgent object to connect to the OpenWeatherMap API.
    uagent = uagent.UserAgent()

    # Start a loop to check the temperature regularly and send an alert if necessary.
    while True:
        temperature = get_temperature(location)

        if temperature < minimum_temperature or temperature > maximum_temperature:
            message = f"Alert! The temperature in {location} is {temperature} degrees Celsius, which is outside of your preferred temperature range of {minimum_temperature} to {maximum_temperature} degrees Celsius."
            send_alert(message)

        # Wait for 15 minutes before checking the temperature again.
        time.sleep(60 * 15)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
